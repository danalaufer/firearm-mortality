## Firearm Background Checks and Mortality Rates
# Overview
In this study, I address the problems of gun violence and political polarization in the United
States. Using datasets on firearm background checks and mortality rates, both collected by
the United States government, I investigate the nature of firearm sales by state over time in
the United States, and analyze the relationship between deaths from firearms and firearm
sales. Using principal component analysis, I conclude that while states with higher firearm
sales tend to be Republican and states with lower firearm sales tend to be Democratic,
the vast majority of states reside somewhere in the middle with no clear trends in political
party. In addition, I construct a regression model to conclude that there is a positive linear
relationship between firearm sales and deaths by firearms in the United States.
